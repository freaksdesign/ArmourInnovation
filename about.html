            <p>Hi! I'm Chris</p>
            <!-- <p>
            Ever since I was a young boy, I was fascinated with the way that the world had been built and interconnected. Throughout my life, my obsession with figuring out how everything works has grown and reinforced my passion for technology. This is why I am currently attending the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, Arizona. I have decided on majoring in Network Security for my Bachelor of Science degree. UAT is designated as a Center for Academic Excellence in Information Systems Security Education by the US National Security Agency and is highly recognized by industry and government entities alike. While my education keeps me busy most days, I still make time to spend with my family and friends. When I have extra free time, I spend it working on my hobbies: vehicle repair, 3D printing and gaming. I am a technology enthusiast with a passion for learning.
            </p> -->
<p class="py-2">
            I have always been driven by an unquenchable thirst for understanding the intricacies of our interconnected world. From a young age, my passion for technology has fueled my desire to explore and unravel the complexities of the digital realm, ultimately leading me to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree in Network Security at the prestigious University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, Arizona.
            <p class="py-2">
My journey began with a simple yet profound fascination with the first computer my family brought homeâ€”an IBM desktop running Windows 98. Though I was too young to fully comprehend the workings of the machine, the hours spent playing basic games under the guidance of my older sister ignited a spark that would become a lifelong passion.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
As I ventured into adolescence, I found myself immersed in the world of social media, discovering the creative potential of platforms like MySpace. Eager to personalize my profile, I dove into learning CSS and HTML, unknowingly laying the groundwork for a successful freelance career in web design and administration during my high school years.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
My technological pursuits didn't end there. Throughout high school, I continued to expand my skillset, taking a variety of technology courses, including computer repair and programming. This period of exploration led me to discover a love for robotics, and I became a founding member of the FIRST Robotics Competition team at Coronado High School. Here, I not only honed my technical prowess but also developed crucial teamwork and mentorship skills, which I later employed as a mentor for Hohokam Elementary's FIRST Lego League Team.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
During my high school years, persistent health issues significantly impacted my attendance and academic performance. Faced with these challenges, I refused to let my circumstances define me. After taking the time to focus on my health, I made the difficult decision to pursue my High School Equivalency Diploma. Thanks to the unwavering support of my family, friends, and a particularly influential former teacher, I overcame my self-doubt and anxiety to graduate with the highest test scores in my class.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
This former teacher not only provided emotional support but also recognized my technical abilities and offered me multiple employment opportunities as a systems administrator contractor. Fondly referred to as the "Technical Wizard," I was able to continue honing my skills while making valuable contributions to my school's technology infrastructure. This experience further solidified my passion for technology and reinforced my resolve to pursue higher education in the field.
In my journey to promote STEAM education, I have been actively involved with the SciTech Institute and played a supportive role in the Chief Science Officers (CSO) program. These experiences have allowed me to contribute to my community while inspiring and empowering others to pursue STEAM-related careers.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
As a member of the SciTech team, I have been responsible for data entry, specifically posting STEAM events to help promote community engagement and awareness. This work has allowed me to connect with various nonprofit organizations, industry leaders, and academia, which has helped build a world-class community with a strong understanding of STEAM.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
Although I was not directly part of the CSO program, I played a crucial role as a systems administrator during the event. My responsibilities included web development and IT support, ensuring that the event ran smoothly and participants had access to the necessary resources. This involvement allowed me to work closely with CSOs, advisors, and industry mentors, further strengthening my passion for technology and STEAM education.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
My commitment to promoting STEAM education extends beyond my involvement with the SciTech Institute and the CSO program. I was also part of a startup initiative focused on creating a STEAM after-school program for middle school students. Although the program did not get off the ground, this experience provided me with valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with launching educational programs for young students.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
Being part of this startup allowed me to explore innovative ways to engage middle school students in STEAM education and further refine my skills in program development, project management, and collaboration with like-minded individuals. Despite the program not materializing, the lessons I learned and the connections I made have contributed to my personal and professional growth in the STEAM field.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
As I continue to pursue my academic and professional goals, I remain dedicated to promoting STEAM awareness and fostering a culture of curiosity, innovation, and collaboration. I am eager to apply the knowledge and experiences gained from my involvement with the SciTech Institute, the CSO program, and the STEAM after-school program initiative to make a lasting impact in the world of technology and STEAM education.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
These experiences with both the SciTech Institute and the CSO program have been integral to my passion for technology and STEAM education. They have allowed me to make a tangible impact on my community while inspiring the next generation of global leaders in the STEAM fields. As I continue to pursue my academic and professional goals, I remain committed to promoting STEAM awareness and fostering a culture of curiosity, innovation, and collaboration.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
My academic accomplishments unlocked new doors, allowing me to continue applying my technology skills in various capacities. I mentored robotics teams at Coronado High School, pursued freelance web design projects, and even served as a Systems administrator for my alma mater. Each experience solidified my passion for technology and fueled my resolve to further my education at the University of Advancing Technology.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
Since enrolling at UAT, I've had the privilege of participating in the National Cyber League Competition, both individually and as a member of a team. My consistent high rankings in these competitions stand as a testament to my dedication, skill, and potential in the field of network security.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
Despite my rigorous academic schedule, I make it a point to maintain a healthy work-life balance. When I'm not immersed in my studies or engaging in extracurricular activities, I unwind by indulging in my hobbies of vehicle repair, 3D printing, and gaming. I also cherish the time spent with my family and friends, who have provided unwavering support throughout my journey.
</p>
<p class="py-2">
My story is one of resilience, determination, and a boundless passion for technology. As I forge ahead in my academic and professional pursuits, I remain committed to pushing the boundaries of my capabilities, learning from every experience, and using my skills to create a positive impact on the world around me.

             <p>The most important experience and biggest risk that I have taken so far in my life was having the courage to get my High School Equivalency Diploma. For most people this may not seem like a major feat to undertake, but for me it meant everything. Throughout my high school career, I was plagued with stomach health problems that required me to spend many days out of school. Eventually, my health caused me to fall behind in my school work, and resulted in my choice to remove myself from Coronado High School. After getting my health back on track, I spent the next few years doing freelance Web Design and mentoring Coronadoâ€™s Robotics Team.Throughout all this time, I have always had an urge to continue my academic path. The biggest obstacle that stood in my way was my own self. After so many years of being out of school, I was weighed down with anxiety and self doubt about whether or not I could complete my life goals. Thanks to the encouragement of family, friends and especially my High School CTE teacher, I was able to push past my own limits and successfully passed my High School Equivalency testing. I graduated with the highest test scores in my class. Now that the pressure has subsided, I can now look forward to my future achievements starting with my college career</p>
